Build
-----

 Project is built with Grunt.

 ``` bash
    $ npm install -g grunt-cli
    $ grunt
 ```

Requirements
------------

- AngularJS
- Underscore.js
- jQuery
- jQuery UI
- Angular UI Sortable

Example of including dependencies from CDN [here](demo/index.html)

Getting Started
---------------

See [simple demo](demo) (two widgets) for a quick start.

Running demo with Grunt.

 ``` bash
    $ bower install
    $ grunt demo
 ```

Application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:9000

### download

With bower:

```
bower install malhar-angular-dashboard
```
For legacy reasons, this bower module is also registered as `angular-ui-dashboard`.

Manually:

Download the zip of this repo and use the files in the `dist` folder.

### include

Load `dist/angular-ui-dashboard.js` and `dist/angular-ui-dashboard.css` in your html:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/angular-ui-dashboard/dist/angular-ui-dashboard.css">
<script src="bower_components/angular-ui-dashboard/dist/angular-ui-dashboard.js"></script>
```

Also be sure to add it to your apps dependency list:

```JavaScript
angular.module('yourApp', [
  // other dependencies
  'ui.dashboard'
]);
```

Controller Scope vs. DataModel
-----

Widgets inherit controller scope (so normally different widgets will have bindings to different controller scope properties).

DataModel has direct access to widget scope, each widget has separate instance of DataModel.

![Controller Scope vs. DataModel](docs/scope.png "Controller Scope vs. DataModel")

Usage
-----

Include the dashboard directive on the element you wish to place widgets in:

```HTML
<div dashboard="dashboardOptions"></div>
```

### Custom Template
It is possible to use your own template for the dashboard and widget markup (replacing [template/dashboard.html](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/template/dashboard.html)). To do so, include a `template-url` attribute on the element to become dashboard:

```HTML
<div dashboard="dashboardOptions" template-url="path/to/my-template.html"></div>
```

### dashboardOptions

`dashboardOptions` in the above html is required and should be an object available on the current scope. The options on said object are as follows:


| key | type | default value | required | description
| --- | ---- | ------------- | -------- | -----------
|  widgetDefinitions | Array | n/a | yes | List of Widget Definition Objects. See below for available options on those.
|  defaultWidgets    | Array | n/a | yes | List of objects where an object is `{ name: [NAME_OF_WIDGET_DEFINITION] }`. TODO: Allow just list of names.
|  widgetButtons     | Boolean | true | no | Display buttons for adding and removing widgets.
|  storage   | Object | null | no | If defined, this object should implement three methods: `setItem`, `getItem`, and `removeItem`. See the **Persistence** section below.
|  storageId | String | null | no (yes if `storage` is defined) | This is used as the first parameter passed to the three `storage` methods above. See the **Persistence** | section below.
|  storageHash | String | '' | no | This is used to validate/invalidate loaded state. See the **Persistence** section below.
|  stringifyStorage | Boolean | true | no | If set to true, the dashboard state will be converted to a JSON string before being passed to `storage.setItem`. Likewise, it will be | passed through JSON.parse after being retrieved from `storage.getItem`. See the **Persistence** section below.
|  explicitSave | Boolean | false | no | The dashboard will not automatically save to storage for every change. Saves must instead be called explicitly using the `saveDashboard` | method that is attached to the option event upon initialization.
|  sortableOptions | Object | n/a | no | Allows to specify the various [sortable options](http://api.jqueryui.com/sortable/#options) of the underlying jQuery UI Sortable.
| hideWidgetSettings | Boolean | false | no | If true, the cog button in the top right corner of each widget will not be present. |
| hideWidgetClose    | Boolean | false | no | If true, the "x" button in the top right corner of each widget will not be present. |
| settingsModalOptions | Object | see below | no | The options object to be passed to the `$modal` service for widget settings. See the **Custom Widget Settings** section below. |
| onSettingsClose      | Function | see below | no | The success callback for when a widget settings dialog is closed by the user. See the **Custom Widget Settings** section below. |
| onSettingsDismiss    | Function | see below | no | The error callback for when a widget settings dialog is dismissed by the user. See the **Custom Widget Settings** section below. |

Upon instantiation, this options object is endowed with a few API methods for use by outside code: `addWidget`, `loadWidgets`, `saveDashboard` and `loadDashboard`.

### Widget Definition Objects

You can think of Widget Definition Objects as a __class__ and the widgets on the page as __instances__ of those classes. The options for a Widget Definition Object are:


| key               | type     | default value | required | description
| ----------------- | ------   | ------------- | -------- | -----------
| name              | Object   | n/a           | true     | Name of Widget Definition Object. If no `templateUrl`, `template`, or `directive` are on the Widget Definition | Object, this is assumed to be a directive name. In other words, the `directive` attribute is set to this value.
| title             | String   | n/a           | false    | Default title of widget instances
| attrs             | Object   | n/a           | false    | Map of attributes to add to the markup of the widget. Changes to these will be stored when using the `storage` option | (see **Persistence** section below).
| templateUrl       | String   | n/a           | false    | URL of template to use for widget content
| template          | String   | n/a           | false    | String template (ignored if templateUrl is present)
| directive         | String   | n/a           | false    | HTML-injectable directive name (eg. `"ng-show"`)
| dataModelType     | Function or String | n/a | false    | Constructor for the dataModel object, which provides data to the widget (see below for more information).
| dataModelOptions  | Object   | n/a           | false    | Arbitrary values to supply to the dataModel. Available on dataModel instance as this.dataModelOptions. Serializable | values in this object will also be saved if `storage` is being used (see the **Persistence** section below).
| dataModelArgs     | Object   | n/a           | false    | Object to be passed to data model constructor function. This object is not serialized by default and if defined should be present in widget definitions.
| dataAttrName      | String   | n/a           | false    | Name of attribute to bind `widgetData` model
| storageHash       | String   | n/a           | false    | This is analogous to the `storageHash` option on the dashboard, except at a widget-level instead of a dashboard-wide | level. This can be helpful if you would only like to invalidate stored state of one widget at a time instead of all widgets.
| settingsModalOptions | Object | see below | no | Overrides same-named option in dashboard options for this widget. See the **Custom Widget Settings** section below. |
| size              | Object   | n/a           | false    | Widget size, e.g { width: '50%', height: '250px' } |
| style             | Object   | n/a           | false    | Widget style, e.g { float: 'right' } |
| enableVerticalResize | Boolean  | true       | false    | Option to enable/disable vertical resize. Should be provided in "widgetDefinitions" since it is not serialized by default. |
| onSettingsClose      | Function | see below | no | Overrides same-named option in dashboard options for this widget. See the **Custom Widget Settings** section below. |
| onSettingsDismiss    | Function | see below | no | Overrides same-named option in dashboard options for this widget. See the **Custom Widget Settings** section below. |


### Widget Resize

Widgets width and height is controlled with `size` attribute (serialized by default). Width can be both unit and percentage based.

Example
```JavaScript
      {
        name: 'fluid',
        directive: 'wt-fluid',
        size: {
          width: '50%',
          height: '250px'
        }
      }
```

Widgets can be resized both horizontally and vertically and size is serialized.

When widget is resized 'widgetResized' event is broadcasted to the widget scope.

### dataModelType

The best way to provide data to a widget is to specify a `dataModelType` in the Widget Definition Object (above). This function is used as a constructor whenever a new widget is instantiated on the page.
If `dataModelType` is a string it will be looked up with $injector (it should be valid AngularJS provider/factory/service).
In most cases data model should implement the following methods: `init`, and `destroy`.
Please see [widget directive file](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/src/directives/widget.js) for implementation details.

#### `setup`
This function is called once when a widget is instantiated. It takes two arguments: (1) the instance of the [`WidgetModel`](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/src/models/widgetModel.js) constructor that corresponds to the widget instance, and (2) the scope of the widget.

#### `init`
This function is called once when a widget is instantiated. This function does not take any arguments.

#### `destroy`
This function is called when the widget is removed from the dashboard. It does not take any arguments. It should be used to clean up any listeners that may otherwise hang around, e.g. unsubscribing to a WebSocket topic or RESTful endpoint.

It is recommended to prototypically extend from the [`WidgetDataModel`](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/src/models/widgetDataModel.js) constructor, which implements the `setup` function. [Take a look at the code here](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/src/models/widgetDataModel.js).

Here is an example way to extend from `WidgetDataModel`:

```JavaScript
angular.module('myApp')
  // Inject other services like $http here, if necessary:
  .factory('MyDataModel', ['WidgetDataModel', function (WidgetDataModel) {
      function MyDataModel() {}
      MyDataModel.prototype = Object.create(WidgetDataModel.prototype);
      MyDataModel.prototype.init = function() {
        // My custom data model setup, like subscribing
        // to WebSocket or starting a REST call interval
      }
      MyDataModel.prototype.destroy = function() {
        // My custom data model teardown, like unsubscribing
        // to WebSocket or clearing a setInterval
      }
      return MyDataModel;
    }]);
```

Persistence
-----------
This dashboard component offers a means to save the state of the user's dashboard. Specifically, the dashboard can automatically save:

- instantiated widgets
- size of widgets (width and height)
- order that widgets are displayed
- widget titles
- any serializable data stored in `dataModelOptions` if the widget instance has a `ds` (instantiated `dataModelType`)

There are three options you can specify in the `dashboardOptions` object relating to persistence:

### `storage` (Object)
This object will be used by the dashboard to save its state. It should implement the following three methods:

- **storage.getItem(String `key`)**
  This method will be used to attempt to retrieve previous dashboard state. It can return either a string or a promise. "promise" in this context simply means an object that has a `then` function that takes a `successCallback` and `errorCallback` as its first and second arguments. This follows the most common promise interface (it works with angular's `$q` promise, jQuery's `$.Deferred()` promise, and many others).
- **storage.setItem(String `key`, String `value`)**
  This method is assumed to store `value` in a way that will be accessible later via the `getItem` method above.
- **storage.removeItem(String `key`)**
  This method is assumed to remove items set with the `setItem` method above.

### `storageId` (String)
This string will be used as the `key` argument in the three methods on the `storage` object, outlined above. This allows for multiple dashboard instances to exist with storage on a single page and site. **This is required in order for storage to work.**

### `storageHash` (String)
This string will be stored along with the dashboard state. Then later, when state is loaded, the loaded value will be compared to the value passed to `dashboardOptions`. If the values are different, the item in storage will be assumed to be invalid and `removeItem` will be called to clear it out. This is so that if you as the developer makes changes that are not backwards compatible with previous dashboard configurations, you can simply change the `storageHash` and not have to worry about strange behavior due to stale dashboard state. **This is optional but is highly recommended.**

### `stringifyStorage` (Boolean)
By default (`stringifyStorage=true`), the dashboard will convert its state (a JavaScript Object) to a string using `JSON.stringify` before passing it to `storage.setItem`. Additionally, the dashboard will assume that `storage.getItem` will return a JSON string and try to parse it with `JSON.parse`. This works with `window.localStorage` nicely, since objects cannot be used as `value` in `localStorage.setItem(key, value)`. However, if you are implementing your own `storage` and would not like this stringification business, set `stringifyStorage` to `false`.


Custom Widget Settings
----------------------
Unless the `hideWidgetSettings` option is set to true on the dashboard options, each widget by default has a "cog" button in the top right corner that, when clicked, opens up a "modal" (dialog box) with information about the widget and controls to change the title. As of this writing, the default functionality is very minimal; only the widget's title can be changed from this modal. In many cases, you will want to replace and extend the default functionality. In rarer cases, you may even want to override the functionality for a specific widget class. Both of these use-cases are possible using this module.

### Principles
To understand how these overrides work, it is beneficial to understand what's happening behind the scenes (if you are looking in the code, the relevant snippet is located in `src/directives/dashboard.js`, in the method `openWidgetSettings`). The widget settings modal uses a service called `$modal` from the [angular-bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap) project. Specifically, the dashboard calls `$modal.open(options)` where `options` is an object containing (ehem) options for the $modal service to use. The relevant options for understanding widget settings are:
 
 - `templateUrl`: Should point to the template to be used to build the modal markup. The default in this dashboard is `template/widget-settings-template.html`.
 - `controller`: A string that points to a registered angular controller. This controller handles the behaviors in the modal. The default in this dashboard is `WidgetSettingsCtrl`, located at `src/controllers/widgetSettingsCtrl.js`.
 - `resolve`: An object where key is an injectable name and value is a function that returns the injected value in the controller. In the case of this dashboard, this property is always set to resolve the widget model so it can be injected into the `$modal` controller.

For a full list of options, visit the [angular-bootstrap](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap) website and scroll to the `$modal` service section.

When the user is done viewing the modal, it is either **dismissed** (the user presses "cancel", meaning he wants to discard any changes made) or it is **closed** (the user presses "ok", meaning he wants to save his changes). These two outcomes are handled by a `$modalInstance` promise that is either resolved or rejected (for information on promises, see the [angular documentation](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$q)).

### Overriding Widget Settings for Every Widget
To override the `options` object that gets passed to `$modal.open(options)` for all widgets (i.e. you want to provide a different default templateUrl and/or controller for all widget settings), you may assign an options object to the `settingsModalOptions` key in your dashboard options:

    // ... in your controller 
    $scope.myDashboardOptions = {
      widgetDefinitions: myWidgetDefinitions,
      defaultWidgets: myDefaultWidgets,
      settingsModalOptions: {
        templateUrl: 'my/custom/widgetSettingsTemplate.html',
        controller: 'MyCustomWidgetSettingsCtrl' // defined elsewhere,
        // other $modal.open options can go here, eg:
        // backdrop: false,
        // keyboard: false
      }
    };

**NOTE:** The `resolve` object gets provided to the `$modal` options by the dashboard, and contains only the widget instance as `widget`. If you put `resolve` in `settingsModalOptions` it will be ignored.

To override the callbacks that get passed to the `$modalInstance` promise, assign functions to the `onSettingsClose` and `onSettingsDismiss` keys on your dashboard options:

    // ... in your controller 
    $scope.myDashboardOptions = {
      widgetDefinitions: myWidgetDefinitions,
      defaultWidgets: myDefaultWidgets,
      settingsModalOptions: {
        templateUrl: 'my/custom/widgetSettingsTemplate.html',
        controller: 'MyCustomWidgetSettingsCtrl'
      },
      onSettingsClose: function(resultFromModal, widgetModel, dashboardScope) {
        // do something to update widgetModel, like the default implementation:
        jQuery.extend(true, widget, result);
      },
      onSettingsDismiss: function(reasonForDismissal, dashboardScope) {
        // probably do nothing here, since the user pressed cancel
      }
    };

### Overriding Widget Settings for a Specific Widget Definition
Overriding widget settings for a specific widget is almost exactly like overriding the default for the entire dashboard, except that you place `settingsModalOptions`, `onSettingsClose`, and `onSettingsDismiss` onto the Widget Definition Object itself:

    // ... in your controller 
    $scope.myDashboardOptions = {
      widgetDefinitions: [
        {
          name: 'myAwesomeWidget',
          template: '<div>hello {{widget.title}}</div>',
          settingsModalOptions: {
            templateUrl: 'my/custom/widgetSettingsTemplate.html',
            controller: 'MyCustomWidgetSettingsCtrl'
          },
          onSettingsClose: function(resultFromModal, widgetModel, dashboardScope) {
            // do something to update widgetModel, like the default implementation:
            jQuery.extend(true, widget, result);
          },
          onSettingsDismiss: function(reasonForDismissal, dashboardScope) {
            // probably do nothing here, since the user pressed cancel
          }
        }
      ],
      defaultWidgets: myDefaultWidgets
    };

Dashboard Layouts
-----------------
One common requirement for user-customizable dashboards is the ability to have multiple layouts consisting of the same set of widget definitions. This sounds more confusing than it is, so the best way to understand it is to take a look at the [layouts demo](http://datatorrent.github.io/malhar-angular-dashboard/#/layouts). You can also see this demo by running `grunt demo` and navigating to `/#/layouts` (or `/#/layouts/explicit-saving`, behavior when `options.explicitSave` is `true`). This is achieved by using the `dashboard-layouts` directive:

```HTML
<div dashboard-layouts="layoutOptions"></div>
```

### layoutOptions
The `layoutOptions` object passed to dashboard-layouts tries to mirror `dashboardOptions` as closely as possible:

key | type | default value | required | description
--- | ---- | ------------- | -------- | -----------
 widgetDefinitions | Array | n/a | yes | Same as in `dashboardOptions`
 lockDefaultLayouts | Boolean| false | no | `true` to lock default layouts (prevent from removing and renaming), layout lock can also be controlled with `locked` layout property
 defaultLayouts    | Array | n/a | yes | List of objects where an object is `{ title: [STRING_LAYOUT_TITLE], active: [BOOLEAN_ACTIVE_STATE], locked: [BOOLEAN], defaultWidgets: [ARRAY_DEFAULT_WIDGETS] }`. Note that `defaultWidgets` is the same as in `dashboardOptions`.
 widgetButtons     | Boolean | true | no | Same as in `dashboardOptions`
 storage   | Object | null | no | Same as in `dashboardOptions`, only the saved objects look like: `{ layouts: [...], states: {...}, storageHash: '' }`
 storageId | String | null | no (yes if `storage` is defined) | This is used as the first parameter passed to the three `storage` methods `setItem`, `getItem`, `removeItem`. See the **Persistence** section above.
 storageHash | String | '' | no | Same as in `dashboardOptions`
 stringifyStorage | Boolean | true | no | Same as in `dashboardOptions`
 explicitSave | Boolean | false | no | Same as in `dashboardOptions`
 sortableOptions | Object | n/a | no | Same as in 'dashboardOptions'


As with `dashboardOptions`, `layoutOptions` gets endowed with the methods `addWidget`, `loadWidgets`, `saveDashboard` and `loadDashboard`. These will be applied to the currently active dashboard layout. Additionally, a method called `saveLayouts` is attached to the `layoutOptions` object. This method will save the state of the layouts explicitly.
